# COVID-19-Patient-Logistic-Regression

You can find the data set <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meirnizri/covid19-dataset">here<a>.

This data analysis for a COVID-19 dataset is meant to further my understanding of logistic regression. 

During this project, I improved my ability to explore and preprocess data. Using seaborn as a data visualization tool, I displayed distributions accross age among COVID patients. I was also able to show users that there was an imbalance in classification for the target feature.

Using up-sampling as a technique, the performance of the prediction model for predicting the mortality of COVID patients was significantly improved. Confusion matrices were used to clearly display classification model performance to users.
